## Getting Started

Welcome to my portfolio! My intention in building this is to showcase the skills I've acquired in blockchain development. I will continue adding to this site as I contionue my web3 journey.

Website built using:
Next.js 13 || TailwindCSS || Framer Motion || Ethers.js

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
# then
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
